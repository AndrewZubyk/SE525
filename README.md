All prompts in the file are shown with example formats of how to properly fill out the prompt, yet in case a reminder is needed.

All numerical inputs for tileSet size and water and asprin locations will be in format:
"1 1" with two numbers and a space between them.

The number of simulations must be in an integer format.

Finally, for the storing of the file input whatever you would like the file name to be. If you have a folder created please designate the folder location:
